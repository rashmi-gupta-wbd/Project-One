1. Firstly we understand what are the GitHub actions, and how these actions are created on the project. ‚úÖ
2. Next, we try to uderstand more about the actions workflow(creating more than one workflow, creating a workflow_event dispatch trigger).‚úÖ
3. We now need to understand how can we trigger one action to be called after the first trgigger is successful‚úÖ
4. Both our workflows would need user input that would be different for both the workflows‚úÖ
5. The action was being triggered on being pushed, as well as manually on the workflow dispatch, so we removed the feature to automatically run the workflow on push.‚úÖ
6. Our workflow is working only for the main branch at the moment, but we want to make it available for all the branches.‚úÖ
7. Next, we wanted completion of one workflow triggering the other workflow's start, which we achieved by correctly copying the "name" of the deployment_workflow in the second workflow ‚úÖ
8. The dynamic name in the second workflow should take the imput of its name from the first workflow. üòï 
this is bit tricky as setting some values we need form the first workflow, and then on usig it as a input for the second workflow, we are getting some error, as it is unable to detect the outputs generated from the first.
9. Next we wanted to take separate inputs for the two workflows ‚ùå this is not possible in github actions simply. the doc suggests that we can just take the inputs for thesecond while triggering the first job itself, which we are having some problem with lately... but this could be ONE OF THE IDEAS 
##to take the inputs of the validations checks at the start itself
